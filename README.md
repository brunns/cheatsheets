# Simon's Cheatsheets

Various cheetsheets in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format. PDFs generated with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). Run `make help` for options.

## TODO

Fill in the cheatsheets, obviously. But also I'd like tognerate the PDFs with 2 or 3 ccolumns, but this pandoc issue - [longtable not compatible with 2-column LaTeX documents](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/1023) - is preventing me.
